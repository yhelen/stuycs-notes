If python interpreter is running a module (the src file) as the main program,
it sets the special, built in `__name__` variable to "`__main__`"
If the file is being imported from another module, `__name__` will be set to
the module's name.

Flask will serve a page under either of these 2 conditions:
1) its route is defined in flask app
2) it is stored in /static
A flask app considers the dir containing .py file as its root.
