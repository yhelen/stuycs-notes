# Aim: Variables are the spice of life

Commands in c are often explained in sections 2/3 of *man*

C was meant for a time when machines were not as powerful
Unlike Java, C will not include all functions (unlike *import*)

=== Including Libraries ===
    To use functions defined in other files, 2 things happen:
    1. Check that you are using the function correctly
        That the arguments and returnt ype match the function definition
    2. Link the code for the external function to your executable code
        *gcc* can automatically link functions in standard libraries
        Therefore, only containing functions that you use

#include
    Used to include function headers with your code.
    Necessary to match arguments and return types (step 1).
    Not neessary for linking (step 2).
    Put system libraries inside <>
        e.g. *#include <stdio.h>*
    No semicolon after

Standard to include:
*stdio.h*
*stdlib.h*
