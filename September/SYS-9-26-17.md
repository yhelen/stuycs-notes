# Aim:

Writing a function with a function being passed in: you really pass a pointer
to the array not a copy of the array

You can declare a function header before use OR in a `.h` file:
```c
void fxn_name(int *, char);
```

If in a `.h` file, remember to include:
```c
#include "header_name.h"
```

You must declare a function before you use it. Done in few ways:
1. Write the entire function at the top of your code. Make sure your order is correct!
2. Write function headers at the top, then define later.
3. Put al function headers in another file (`.h`). Then include and provide
   definitions there.
