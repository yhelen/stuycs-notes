# Aim: A vast array of possibilities

Data Types and Variables
    Character literals are single characters inside ''
        eg. 'a', '*', ...
    String literals exists, even though there is no String data type
        eg. "hello", "you smell"
    The order that identifiers are declared in matters.
        This includes functions, so they must be declared before use.

    Variables cannot be declared inside for loop statements
    but they can be initialized.

    Any variable type can be declared an "unsigned variable that
    the variable will never be negative.
        The lower bound of any unsigned variable is 0
        The upper bound will be greater than the signed version
        eg. unsigned char x;
            0 <= x <= 255

    All boolean values are numbers:
        0 is false
        anything else is true

        MISTAKE:
        if(x = 6) {...}
        NEEDS TO BE *if(x==6)*

Memory Management
    Memory allocation either happens at compile time or at runtime (dynamic)
    Compiler Allocated Memory
        Packaged with the binary of the program

        There is no standard default value

        Variables and arrays are allocated here.
            eg. float a
                int b[5]

        Arrays
            Must have a fixed size set at declaration as a literal.

            There is no length function
                You CAN use the *sizeof()* to find the amount of memory allocated
                to that variable.

            There is no boundary checking
