Pointers
    Variables designed to store memory addresses
        (array variable is a kind of pointer)

    * is used to declare a variable as a pointer type
        eg. int *p, double *q, char *r
            (you can put a space after the *)
    & is used to get the address of a variable (address of operator)

    & is also used as the deference operator
        It accesses the value at the memory location stored in a pointer.

    All pointer variable types are the same size.

    Pointer Arithmetic
        int *p = &i;
        char *c = &i;

        p++; // will add 4 to p
        c++; // will add 1 to p

        arrays work as so:
        arr[i] means *(arr+i)
