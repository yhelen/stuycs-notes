# Aim: malloc & free: The dynamic duo!

Dynamic memory allocation
    malloc(size_t size)
        Allocates x bytes of memory (From the heap)
        Returns the address at the beginning of the allocation
        Returns a void *, always typecast to the correct pointer type!!

        int *p;
        p = (int *) malloc(5 * sizeof(int));

    free(void *ptr)
        Releases dynamically allocated memory.

        Takes one paramater, a pointer to the beginning of a
        dynamically allocated block of memory.

        Every call to malloc/calloc should have a corresponding
        call to free.

        Only frees if it is the original pointer.
        Otherwise, segfaults.

        int *p;
        p = (int *)malloc(20);
        free(p)

    calloc(size_t n, size_t x)
        Allocates n * x bytes of memory

        Ensures that each bit is set to 0

        Works like mallloc in all other ways

        int *p;
        p = (int *) calloc(5, sizeof(int));

    realloc(void *p, size_t x)
        Changes the amount of memory allocated to a given block.

        p must be a pointer to the beginning of an allocated block
        of memory, but it does not have to be the original pointer.

        If x is smaller than the oriinal size of allocation, the
        extra bytes will be released.

        If x is larger, it will extend the memory OR reassign and
        copy the information.

        int *p;
        p = (int *)malloc(20);
        p = (int *)realloc(p, 40);
