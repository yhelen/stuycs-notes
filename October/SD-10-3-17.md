# Aim: C for cookie

`request.cookies.get( KEY )`
* accesses cookie data if available
* (no error thrown if key is missing)

`request.cookies.get('username')`
is equivalent to
`request.form['username']`
but will not throw Key error if username is not found

specify routes:
`@app.route('/login', methods=["GET","POST"])`

COOKIE:
* small file given by a website to your web browser for storage
  on your LOCAL machine
* useful for maintaining awareness of identity across multiple page
  visits on same site
* transmitted with request (sniffable)

Session (also "secure")
Flask module to facilitate "remembering users"

Flask session data is maintained by server but stored in cookies on client.
* cookie paylod sniffable, but encoded
* Flask session object works like a dict
* cookie is securely signed

Data is encoded - not encrypted
A stranger can (with a bit of work) view this cookie data, but
not change it.

`from flask import session`

to add data to a session:
`session[KEY] = value`

to remove data from a session:
`session.pop(key)`

Generate a private key, and assign it as built-in secret_key

app.secret_key = *<randomly_generated_string>*

to get a randomized string:

`import os`
`os.urandom(32)` -> 32 bits of random data as a strin[[g]]

MAXIM:
NEVER NEVER NEVER store a private key in a publicy-viewable location
(like GitHub)
