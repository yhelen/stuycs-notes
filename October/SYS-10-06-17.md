# Aim: Finding your type

typedef
    Provide a new name for an existing data type

    typedef <real type> <new name>;
    ex:
        typedef unsigned long size_t;
        size_t x = 139; // x is really an unsigned long

    IMPORTANT
        The use of typedef is another in a long line of
        religious wars in programming (see emacs v vim,
        tabs v spaces, etc.)

Struct
    Create a new type that is a collection of values.

    struct { int a; char x; } s;
    type is `struct { int a; char x }`

    Easier to store as powers of two (struct above is
    5 bytes, but uses 8 bytes)

    `struct foo { int a; char x; };`
        Here, foo is a prototype for this kind of struct,
        to be used later, as such:
        `struct foo s;`

        A variable can be created at the same time as a
        prototype, but is generally unadvised.

    struct foo {
        int a;
        char x;
    };
    ^^ Advised declaration ^^
