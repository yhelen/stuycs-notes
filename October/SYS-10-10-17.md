# Aim: If you don't pay attention you'll get into a heap of trouble!

Struct
    struct foo { int a; char x; } s;

    We use the . operator to access a value inside a struct
        s.a = 10;
        s.x = '@';

        . binds before *
        p = &s
        (*p).x;

        To access data from a struct pointer you can also use ->k:
        p->x; //this is the same as (*p).x

Stack memory vs Heap memory
    Computer programs separate memory usage into two parts: stack and heap.

    Every program can have its own stack and heap.

    Stack memory
        Stores all normally delcared variables (including pointers and structs),
        arrays and function calls

        Functions are pushed onto the stack in the order they are called, and
        popped off when completed.

        When a function is popped off the stack, the stack memory associated
        with it is released.

    Heap Memorythat this occurs
        Stores dynamically allocated memory

        _Data will remain in the heap until it is released._
            (or the program terminates)

        Can be accessed through pointers.

        Can be accessed across many functions.
