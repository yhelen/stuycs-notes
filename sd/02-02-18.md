Paths are used to draw arbitrary shapes, including circles and curves.

* A context can keep track of one path at a time.
* Path is not drawn until `stroke()` is called
* A path is considered done when `beginPath()` is called anew

* `beginPath()` - Starts or resets current path
* `stroke()` - Renders all lines in the path, doe snot end the path.
* `fill()` - Fills the interior of the path, Will not work if the path has fewer
than 3 points in it
* `arc(x, y, radius, startAngle, endAngle)` - Draws an arc
    - `x`, `y` - center of circle that arc is a part of
