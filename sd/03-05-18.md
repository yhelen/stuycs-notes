# Aim: Double bubble toil & trouble

## Event Propogation

1. An element intercepts an event
2. Browser collects DOM node path of the event from the starting element to
   the root
3. Capture: The event propagates down the path from step 2
4. Bubble: The event propagates up the path from step 2

Default: events listeners do not trigger until the bubbling phase

To trigger during capture phrase:
add `true` as option 3rd arg to `addEventListener`

```javascript
x.addEventListener("click", foo, true)
```
