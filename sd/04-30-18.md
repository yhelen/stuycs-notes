# Reductio ad absurdum

`REDUCE`
* list -> single value
* performs "rolling calculation" on successive value pairs

```
from functools import reduce

reduce(fxn, list)

reduce( (lambda x, y: x * y), [1, 2, 3 4])
```

lambda in Python:
* must return a value of ("evulate to", "collapse to")
* should remind you of Scheme/Racket/LISP
* conditionals must be in form of a python ternary op:
    * exprA if condition else exprB
