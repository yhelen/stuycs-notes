## AJAX - Asynchronous Javascript And XML

* Combination of technologies (JS, HTML, DOM, XML)
* System created to send data to a server in the background without
  having to reload the page or wait for the server to acknowledge the
  change.
* eg. AJAX call can send data to a server via GET or POST and then
  catch the server's response.
* Originally, XML was the only supported format for sending/receiving
  data, but now many formats are used, including JSON and plaintext.

AJAX Call by:
`XMLHttpRequest`

...but first, jQuery
* JS lib for streamlining DOM manipulation
* emphasizes, brevity, clarity
* improves cross-platform consistency

To use, dl fr `jquery.com`, link locally:
```javascript
<script src="jquery.js"></script>
```

or CDN.

`$` is used to refer to the jQuery library (its just a fxn tho).

eg.

```javascript
$.somejQueryFxnName()
$( somejQuerySelector )
```

jQuery makes AJAX easy:
* clean wrapper functions for making AJAX calls. Eg.

```javascript
$.ajax( SETTINGS_DICT );
```

`SETTINGS_DICT` is an associative array containing all the information
required to make the call.

Notable settings keys:
* `url`: Server target link
* `type`: method
* `data`: Data to be sent
* `success`: function to be called if server responds

```javascript
$.ajax( {
    url: '/foo',
    type: 'GET',
    data: "look it's information!",
    success: function(d) {
        console.log(d);
    }
};
```

Also has `$.get()` and `$.post()` wrappers.

```javascript
$.get(url, data, callback fxn)
```
