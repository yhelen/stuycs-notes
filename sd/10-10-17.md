## Moments of Inefficiency
We noted that for the three basic pages of our website, `"/"`, `"/auth"`, and `"/welcome"`, they each could call/called [Form] and [Response].

## How It Should Be
In the end, we decided only the `/welcome` route should display the [Response], and if there is no one logged in it should `redirect(url_for("login_method"))`.

The `/` and `/auth` routes have [Form] only and should `redirect(url_for("welcome_method"))` to it upon finding the right login information. The root route should still display a [Form], just so something shows up.

## Jinja Syntax
`{% ... %}` is used for statements

`{{ ... }}` is used for expressions

`{# ... #}` is used for comments

### INHERITANCE (my old friend) in Jinja
**Jinja supports inheritance**

Why inheritance? So you can make a template that contains items present in all pages, such that other templates can derive from and modify it. Less to write.

### How to Inherit
file 'base.html'

```
<!DOCTYPE html>
<head>
     {% block head %}
     <title>
     {% block title %} {% endblock %}
     -|- My Foist Webpage {# <-- a default, displays "-|- My Foist Webpage" if left as is #}
     </title>
     {% endblock %}
</head>
<body>
     {% block content %}
     No hablo queso. <br>
     {% endblock %}
     {% block footer %}
     Didn't get a chance to copy this down.
     {% endblock%}
</body>
```

now to inherit:

file 'ditto.html'
```
{% extends "base.html" %} {# must be the first line #}

{# call a block by its name to insert code in designated area #}
{% block title %}
Index {# <-- title appears as "Index -|- My Foist Webpage", unless... #}
{% endblock %}

{# in the case of nested blocks, the block on the outside would overwrite the one inside #}
{% block head %}
WE HURRR
{% endblock %}

{% block content %}
<h1> Index </hi>
<p> A quick tutorial on blocks in Jinja </p>
{% endblock %}
