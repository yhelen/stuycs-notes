# Aim: Add more tools to workbench

You will eventually want these subdirs:
*/static* for front end only pages
*/templates*
*/data* (for programmer's convenience, not necessary)
*/util* any extra computation to be imported (for programmer's convenience, not necessary)

*/static*
Stuff to store:
* images (that you don't mind being public
* CSS
* static HTML files (non-template)

Jinja2 facilities
* separation of content from design
* reduction of repetition
using
* conditionals
* looping structures
* etc...

Jinja2 syntax for a conditional
```
{% if a %}
    {{a}}
{% endif %}
```
for a loop
```
{% for i in d %}
    {{ i }}
    <br>
{% endfor %}
```
