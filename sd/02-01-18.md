## Enter the CANVAS

* HTML5 element that provides a drawing area
* JS fxns can draw on a canvas element
* You must give it an ID so you can reach it
* You must declare a rendering context
    - e.g. 2D drawing, 3D drawing, raw bitmap rendering
* Only 2 attributes: height & width
    - default w: 300, h: 150
    - Assignable via DOM manipulation

```javascript
var c = document.getElementById( ID );
var ctx = c.getContext("2d");
ctx.fillStyle = COLOR;
ctx.fillRect(50, 50, 100, 200);

fillStyle()
strokeStyle()
clearRect()
fillText()
```
