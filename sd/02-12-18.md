### Beef with SQL database?

* fixed schema (must be known ahead of time)
* lists are problematic
* redundant data (in bad way)
* must live on single host

## NoSQL

Alternative to relational, schema-oriented DB: document-oriented DB.

Non table-based/relational DB.
Not nearly as popular as relational DBs. (BTW not all relational DBs are SQL)
but growing footprint bc of 1st century web apps, Big Data

e.g.

* Key-Value: DB is essentially a huge dictionary
* Graph: DB stored as graph. Relationship bt nodes crucial.
* Document: DB is a collection of documents, each containing varying data
  (amount, type)

Document-oriented DB rough equivalences:
| SQL    | DocDB      |
| ------ | ---------- |
| record | doc        |
| table  | collection |

## Document-oriented DB

* each record stored as a doc (instead of row in table)
* each doc contains
    * all data associated with given record
    * key-value pairs ("fields" with values)
* fields need no type specification
* a field may contain different types of data, e.g. lists, dicts, etc.
* docs may be grouped together in a collection (roughly equivalent to
  a relDB table)
* docs in a collection need NOT have same complement of fields
* each doc gets primary key, usually assigned by DB mgr
* docs need not be stored on same storage device

We will use a(n overly?) popular doc DB: MongoDB

Example:
```
{
    _id: ObjectID( ID ),
    title: 'this is huMONGOus!',
    descript: "NoSQL is not only SQL',
    tags: ['noSQL', 'db', 'atabase'],
    comments: [
        {
        user: 'imma_troll_9000',
        msg: 'potter sux, 4chan rules lulz bye'
        datePosted: new Date(2017, 1, 31, 7, 45}
        }
    ]
}
```

Making MongoDB work for you:
* employs separate server/daemon (as opposed to sqlite, which stores
  entire DB as single file), (most enterprise SQL implementations use a
  server also...)
* facilitates distribution of DB over many hosts if req
