# Aim: Cold LAMPin' with Flav

web server is simply a process listening in for HTTPS requests and
responding to them.

Flask is a "microframework"

We've been using Flask's built-in web server...

### Flask's webserver:
* great for dev & debugging
* simple, fast, ez to turn on/off
* suboptimal for full-time site serving
* single-threaded: each request handled sequentially, visitors must wait
  for prior requests to resolve before theirs gets processed
* not designed to protect your app/host from malicious attacks
* not intended to be long-term, persistent, high-volume server

### production web servers

* designed to handle high quantity of requests
* commonly use separate processes/threads for each request (often called
  "workers")
* can serve multiple sites/apps from same host
* eg:
    * apache
    * nginx
    * green unicorn
        * more robust than flask, less than apache/nginx
        * requires minimal config

#### Apache

* longstanding
* familiarity (tbm & dw)
* no major advantage in nginx or competing
* each unique site (distinct domain name) is a Virtual Host
* all processes run as `user www-data`/`group www-data` (important if
  reads/writes local files)
* config files live in `/etc/apache2`
* websites live in `/var/www`

goal: apache2 as web serer, but flask as site backend

#### Web Server Gateway Interface

* convention/set of common fxn names
* allows conventional web server to fwd requests to a microframework like
  Flask

### File organization

1. rename flask app to `__init__.py`
2. entire flask app in a single dir, named after your app
3. put this dir in another of same name
4. in outer dir, create file <appname>.wsgi

```
wolframbeta/
|--wolframbeta
|  |--__init__.py
|  |--static
|  |  |--css
|  |  |--js
|  |--templates
|  |--util
|--wolframbeta.conf
|--wolframbeta.wsgi
```


```
sudo apt install apache2
sudo apt install libapache2-mod-wsgi
sudo a2enmod wsgi
sudo serice apache2 restart
```
