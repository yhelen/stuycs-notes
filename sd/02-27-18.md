# Aim: What's yer Vector, Victor?

raster encoding: bit-by-bit specification of an image (even if compressed)

## XML (eXtensible Markup Language)

A markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a
format which is both human-readable and machine-readable.

* not a formatting language (ie HTML, GHFMD)
* framework for creating markup based grammars
* uses some syntactic standards of HTML (tags, attributes)
* focus on sorting and representing data instead of rendering and
  displaying it
* an XML namespace is defined by the tags and attributes associated with
  a specific XML language

### ...like SVG:

* Scalable Vector Graphics
* vector image format
* XML-based
* an SVG img and its actions are defined in XML text files

Vector graphics are images nto represented as a 2D grid of pixels (raster)
but instead as a list of drawing command (eg: line, circle, rectangle, curve)

Biggest advantage to vector graphics is that they are scalable to any
size without resulting in pixelation.

`<svg>` element is designed to store SVG ode (ie SVG XML elements)
`xmlns`: Attribute that identifies the namespace for the specific XML
language being used.

eg.
```xml
<svg xmlns="https://www.w3.org/2000/svg"> YOUR CODE HERE </svg>
